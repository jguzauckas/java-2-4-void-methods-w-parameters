# You Do

In `Do.java`, perform each of the following:

- Create a `Person` with age 5, is a student, height of 30.0 inches, and was born in 2018 and save it to a variable.
- Print a greeting from the person and have them add 10 and 13.2 together.
- Create a `Person` with default information and save it to another variable.
- Print this person's age in 15 years and have them add 12.1 and 5.1 together.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
