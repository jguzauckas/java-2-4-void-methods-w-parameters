# Initial Try

Can you fix the first line to properly construct a `Person` object?

Can you fix the two method calls so that both methods in `Person` are called on the object?

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
